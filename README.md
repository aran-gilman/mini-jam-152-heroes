# Overview

Play on the web at https://aran-makes-games.itch.io/wizard-battle.

Defeat the wizard by reflecting his projectiles back at him.

Each projectile has a color associated with it. Hitting a small projectile with a sword of the matching color destroys it; hitting a large projectile sends it back to the wizard, dealing damage to him.

You can carry at most two swords at a time. Hitting a sword on the ground with one of your current swords swaps it out.

When the wizard's health reaches 0, the game advances to the next phase. The wizard regains his health and utilizes new attack patterns. After 3 phases, the door to the next arena opens.
